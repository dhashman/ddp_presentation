# Coursera Developing Data Products presentation

This presentation is part of the Coursera Developing Data Products project.

In the presentation, we pitch our Shiny app that was developed as part of the course project. 
In particular, we create a web page using Slidify with an html5 slide deck.

To meet the course requirements, this presentation satisfies the following:

1. It was done in Slidify.
2. It is 5 pages long (inclusive of the title page).
3. It is hosted on github.
4. It contains some embedded R code that gets run when slidifying the document.
